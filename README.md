# Imago
An open-source app for scientific research on dream recall and psychological well-being.

## Introduction
Imago is a project initiated by a clinical psychologist with a psychoanalytic approach, based in Turin, Italy, to launch a scientific study. The goal is to demonstrate that consistent dream recall can enhance psychological well-being. The app collects dream and mood data from users, offers advanced semantic analysis, facilitates anonymous dream sharing between nearby users, and provides tools to improve recall, with a strong emphasis on privacy and education.

## Planned Features
- **Dream Logging**: Users can write or record dreams via voice (with automatic transcription).
  - **Dream Context**: Optional input on daily events or sleep quality (e.g., “Stressful day / Restful sleep”).
- **Monthly Interview**: Upon first use, a brief psychological well-being questionnaire (e.g., anxiety, mood, sleep quality), repeated monthly to track progress.
- **Custom Tags**: Users can add tags to categorize dreams (e.g., #nightmare, #happiness).
- **Advanced Semantic Analysis**: Integrated software analyzes dream text, providing a graph showing:
  - Emotional connotations (positive/negative).
  - Recurring themes (e.g., “water,” “falling”).
  - Emotional intensity (e.g., “mild fear” vs “intense joy”).
  - Optional psychoanalytic prompts (e.g., “Does this symbol remind you of something?”).
- **Anonymous Dream Sharing**: When two users with Imago installed come into physical proximity, the app automatically exchanges their most recent dream anonymously (no personal details shared).
- **Exportable Reports**: Downloadable summaries (PDF or visual) of dreams, mood trends, and analysis, useful for users or therapists.
- **Personalized Tips**: Tailored advice to improve dream recall, adjusted based on user feedback (“Did this help? Yes/No”).
- **Educational Section**: Short texts on the link between dreams and well-being (e.g., “How dreams reflect the unconscious”).
- **Privacy**: Local storage option with anonymized data sharing for research, including encryption.
- **Subtle Gamification**: “Recall Streak” counter (e.g., “5 days in a row!”) and unlockable tips after milestones.

## Scientific Goal
Collect anonymized data to investigate:
1. Whether regular dream recall correlates with improved psychological well-being.
2. How emotional patterns and recurring themes in dreams reflect mental states over time.
3. Which factors (e.g., daily context, recall tips) influence dream recall effectiveness.
4. The psychological impact of anonymously sharing dreams with strangers.

## Project Status
- **Current Stage**: Concept phase. No working prototype yet.
- **Needs**: Seeking developers to build the app, integrate semantic analysis, and set up a secure database and proximity-based sharing.

## Suggested Technologies (to be defined with collaborators)
- Mobile app (iOS/Android) or web-based.
- Database for storing dreams, mood, and interviews (e.g., Firebase, SQLite).
- Semantic analysis with NLP models (e.g., BERT, NLTK) and voice transcription (e.g., Whisper).
- Proximity detection for dream sharing (e.g., Bluetooth, NFC, or geolocation APIs).
- Interactive charts (e.g., Chart.js).
- Minimalist design with a psychoanalytic flair (dark backgrounds, symbolic imagery like inkblots).

## How to Contribute
I’m a psychologist with no programming skills, but I bring my clinical and psychoanalytic expertise to shape this project. I’m looking for:
- Developers for mobile/web apps.
- Experts in semantic analysis/NLP, voice transcription, and proximity-based features.
- Designers for a simple, intuitive interface.
- Researchers interested in collaborating on the study.

## Next Steps
- Build a basic prototype.
- Develop a scientifically validated questionnaire.
- Integrate semantic analysis, privacy features, and anonymous dream sharing.
- Launch a beta version to collect pilot data.

Thank you for your interest! Let’s collaborate to explore the unconscious and psychological well-being through technology.
